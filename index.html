<br><h1>SearchKit & RevelariOS - Taking a dive into the vm_region()</h1>
<i>September 28, 2020</i>
<p>Searching through memory on iOS to find a specific value isn't a new idea. There's plenty of tools available for searching memory on iOS, and source code is available for most of them. However, the source code only explains the <i>how</i> behind the project but not the <i>why</i>. The goal of RevelariOS was to create a technical version of these tools with a <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> explaination available through a combination of this blog post and the source code. SearchKit is meant to be a development toolkit so developers can add memory searching in their own projects, while RevelariOS is built to show off the power of SearchKit and its potential uses in research and development. In order to explain how RevelariOS and similar programs work, we have to take a dive into the vm_region().</p>

<br><h1>Breaking the Trust - Manipulating asset files in Supercell games</h1>
<i>June 1, 2020</i>
<p>In Supercell games, asset files are stored as .csv files for general information used in the game while .sc files contain the graphics. All .csv file contents are stored as primitive data types (int, bool, String, etc). Prior to December of 2019, for over 7 years after Clash of Clans' launch, asset files were not scanned by the game for modification or signed to check integrity. The implications of this being that any user could write their own edits into the .csv files and load them into the game. Most data stored in the .csv files is checked against the server, so trying to modify an achievement and getting 9 million gems for completing it will cause the game to "Out of Sync" and reset since the client calculations are different than what the server expected. Although this system is mostly bulletproof, occasionally a few bugs slip through the cracks.</p>
